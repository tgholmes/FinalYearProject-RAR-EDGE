Hello!
This repository contains the code I wrote and used to complete my Final Year Project (dissertation) as part of my Physics BSc degree at the University of Surrey, supervised by Justin Read

The project is focused upon the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR), which describes the relation between the baryonic (expected) and observed gravitational accelerations within galaxies, calculated at different radii.

A strong relation had been discovered for larger (observed) galaxies (see Lelli + McGaugh ApJ 2017). Using high-resolution dwarf galaxy simulations from the Engineering-Dwarfs-at-Galaxy-Formations-Edge (EDGE) 
project (see link on homepage), I aimed to see if the relation discovered by Lelli + McGaugh for larger galaxies aligns with these dwarf galaxies when extrapolated down to lower accelerations. 
This was novel research into the dynamics of dark matter within these small galaxies and how their profiles fit into a larger cosmological picture. Reach out if you wish to find out more.

The 5 galaxy simulations used throughout my research are taken from the 2021 Matthew Orkney et al paper (https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab1066)

The code in this repository features techniques and packages that I have learnt throughout my coding experience during my degree. It was a test of my mathematical and computational ability, but the results
I obtained were great, and are set to be included in an upcoming paper, published to an esteemed Astrophysics Journal (see Julio et al 2024 in prep)
